General Description:
This repo is the worker of a project called TurboBackend. This Worker will handle background job processing.
TurboBackend is a platform that allows users to generate up backend code and spin up infra
by simply connecting our MCP to their AI IDE coding agent of choice,
such as Kiro, Cursor or Windsurf, and prompting our platform to create a backend
for their application. TurboBackend then instantly generates production-ready
backend code with accompanying infrastructure on their own cloud accounts of choice. 
Users can continually modify their backend code by simply prompting our MCP in their AI IDE.
