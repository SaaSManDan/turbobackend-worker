# Claude Code Rules

## General instructions to Claude Code
- In Javascript, always use regular functions, not arrow functions.
- When making api calls in any javascript file, use try/catch instead of promise chaining.
- Use ES6 syntax for import/export.
- If I say "dncc", that means do not add, modify or change any code.
- Use the "Postgres Database Tables" section of technicalContext.txt file to reference this project's database schema/structure when i mention my database tables or ask you to create postgres sql query
- Use the generalContext.txt file to understand the general context and user flow of the application so you have an understanding of what is being built and make better decisions
